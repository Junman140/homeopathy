1
The alternative medicine is as old as the human race itself. It is the most intriguing, fascinating, and enthralling phenomena in the history of medicine. Although these authentic alternative medical sciences has been dismissed as a faddish when accessed by a fringe minority. It was founded on a sound principles and philosophy, tried and tested and has assumed an international legendary for curing the incurable diseases, radically in all their ramifications, with no side effect or health hazard.
About ten years ago, Royal society of medicine wherein practitioners of orthodox and alternative medicine sat down together in an attempt to discover common ground. These meetings provided a landmark occasion which help, to destroy the stereotype image that each branch held of the other. Thus say, we on the orthodox wing recognized that our opponents were not quacks and charlatans, but sincere good people, deeply compassionate searching for the truth for the benefit of mankind. In return the order side of the house recognizes that we were not a conspiracy of a self serving establishment seeking to crush new ideas that happen to arise outside of our own ranks. Infarct, and this should come as no surprise, we shared a common goal which was the offer of our best for the improvement of length and quality of life of our sick and frightened patients.
he major demarcation between orthodox and alternative medicine is one of epistemology or the philosophical underpinning of our quest for knowledge. Definitely, that until the early years of this century, there was no clear boundary between mainstream and fringe medicine other than the social status, respectability and income of their proponent. However, with the development of 20th centary scientific philosophy, unnoticed by the medical profession itself (with a few rare exceptions) orthodox medicine has drifted towards a deductive

THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE MODERN
COLLEGE OF HOMOEOPATHY/ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE
The College was founded by late Dr. E. U. Umoren in the then Cross river State
in 1982, with the name COTTAGE HOMOEOPATHIC MEDICAL
COLLEGE AND HOSPITAL, located at 60 Aka Road Uyo. It was dedicated
to the teaching of classical and modern Homoeopathy as well as other
alternative medicine with the expertise of qualified expatriates, for imparting
the medical philosophy of Dr. Samuel Christian Frederick Hahnemann, the
founder of Homoeopathy with accuracy and vigor. He consolidated the
existence of this college till the period of major reforms. Indeed, he is honored
as the major epochal figure in the history of the practice of Homoeopathic
medicine in Nigeria.
As he practiced and disseminated with powerful authority the principles
of Homoeopathy and the Natural therapeutics, the entire Nigerians graciously
gave him the title of "founder and father" of Homoeopathic medicine in
Nigeria. Through this singular effort of dedicated teaching which he started in
1940 in collaboration and affiliation with college and universities abroad for

to segregate and hate no more, and so we live our lives to God".
Dr. Effiong Udo Umoren, was born and baptized into Qua Iboe church. He was one of the most
devoted members who contributed immensely to the growth of the church. His sagacious and
prodigious intellect has been a source of help to many. He was noted as a rare gem and a
confounded intellectual snob, a prototype of an inventive genius. His gift of elocution, phonetic
diction, creativity, styles of speaking and legibility in writing and his photographic memory culture
has raised the admiration of the church dignitaries and village community to see him as a semi-god
He will be called upon to explain, to elucidate, to use the significant fact to light up the dark caverns
of ignorance.
In Qua Iboe church he was a very good singer, choir master and a Sunday school teacher.
He declined in the activities of the church when he had an electric shock that affected his spine and
could not seat comfortably in public places but maintained Christian life at home. He exercised his
mind with contemplation and his body with action and preserved the health of both. Until death he
had been conducting morning and evening prayer with his family. His Christian life achievement
would be incomplete if we fail to mention that Dr. Effiong Udo Umoren at his youthful age of 12
claimed he had a divine call to start a ministry. Because of his devotion many found him as a
messiah, and departed from other denominations and joined him in devotion and worship. He
collected money for church offering and tithe, he issued communion with the use of coconut water
Many converts made a testimony of deliverance. There was no civilization during this period, He
used Bamboo wood and palm frond "Eyei" to make his shoes and tie and operated this ministry
under a tent. Qua Iboe church dignitaries from Ikot Eyo village and the Headquarters at Iben
thought this would bring about division in the church. They called him to order which he didn't
hesitate. He demonstrated his love for the church when he leased his property (House) by gratis
Qua Iboe church, Ikot Eyo for worship centre. He showed kindness and generosity to the church by
sending to them money, church Hymnaries and bibles every year.
Dr. Effiong Udo Umoren was an authentic exponent of the basic principles which are the
fundamental of all the ancient physicians, religionist and philosophers, he only lives them but has
mastered them, his lucid exegesis comes fresh from divine wisdom born of deep and penetrating
intuition and not from a mere study of the medical lore alone.
On 18th December, 2002 he organized the end of the year party with his students, he addressed the
students on the way of life and concluded in his speech that there is time to live and a time to die. At
night he took his bible to his bedroom, kept it open and slept. The following morning he spelled a
peaceful transition. Everyone was struck dumb, reeled in shock and stood transfixed in bewilderment
trepidation and saw at first the departure of their Dean, Rector, Physician, Director, friend joining
his ancestors.

THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE FIRST PRACTITIONER AND FOUNDER
OF HOMEOPATHY IN NIGERIA DR. EFFIONG UDO UMOREN
18th December, 1901-18th Dec. 2002

once in a century a man is born with a genius that seems to be godlike and fortunate indeed is
the country where such a one is born, for it become deathless for all time. Such a man was
Dr. Effiong Udo Umoren, Philosopher, Symptomatologist, a scientist and patriot. I do not
know of anyone having an equal amplitude of mind, with him was touched with the light of genius.
That indeed is something memorable. And memorable also was his versatility, his many sidedness.
He was a symptomatologist of unique vision, a disseminator, who spread with powerful authority
the teaching of the world founder of Homeopathy, Dr. Samuel Christian Frederick Hahnemann to
the entire medical system of Nigeria and became the Founder and father of Homeopathy in
Nigeria. The story of his life is easily told.
He was born on the 18th December, 1901 into the family of Nung Umoren in Ikot Akpan, Ikot-Eyo in
Ubium clan, Nsit Ubium Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. His father Effiong Udo
Umoren was a popular and renowned herbalist, a traditional medicine healer and farmer. His
mother Mrs. Edemekong Udo Umoren was from Obio Akpa Idu in Ubium clan, the village in which
all the Ubium indigenes acknowledge as a common ancestral home.

Though his mind refused the narrow discipline of school, it absorbed from the culture of Dr. John
Udo Ekpo, which Calabar International Airport is named after his wife, a highly gifted brother,
whose thoughts, emotions and ideals that embodied the finest element of our national genius.
Upon these his mind worked and out of them he became the first practitioner of homeopathic
system of medicinen Nigeria of which is universally acknowledged.

He was a great man, above all littleness, without petty envies, jealousies and prejudice that afflict
the ordinary man.

Dr. E. U Umoren was dedicated to a noble ideal, entirely selfless, free from all narrowness, truthful
in speech, fearless in action, meek as a lamp, but a lion in spirit. He appealed to the noblest
elements of our nature, refusing to believe in the cheap common places of modern cynicism.

He called all Nigerian to believe and have faith in the fundamental principles of homeopathy as a
value of life. He was a great dreamer of dreams and a doer of deeds: among the great, equal to the
greatest; among the humble, one of the humblest.

He was reserved in his early life and loved to live a quite life till death, not associating with un-
purposeful people.

Dr. E. U Umoren was termed as an extra-ordinary boy with hidden virtue. His father could not
understand him nor others. His intelligence was a head of his time. He was an inquisitive child,
curious, witty and meticulous, researchful and fond of asking questions, wanting to know always.
He had a flair for reading and always associated himself with those the parent were opportuned to
sponsor in schools. He was interested in his father's traditional effort in the cure of individual
ailments and findings, lack of differentiation of phantasm and reality in his father's search for
solution to diagnosis and finding and solving individuals problems in a traditional way gave him a
breath of vision and a sensitivity coupled with knowledge and admiration for the philosophical
works led him to his eventual insight in wholistic research for attainment of wisdom. His father was

reading transpired to make him a boy of letters and possessed of abundance of charisma, which
gave him initiative for revolution in the form of a new school or any discovery and invention. He was
taken by a British District Officer (D.O) who later sent him to a native authority school at Ikot Okwot
where he completed his standard three.
He then proceeded to the Presbyterian Primary School at Itu where he finished his standard six
education. He took the General Certificate of Education, Junior Cambridge in 1920. In 1925, he sat
for London matriculation examination that qualified him entry for higher courses.
His creative thinking involved a good balance of imagination and logic. He was the first to have
introduced self-education in Ubium. By any yard stick, he was considered as the beacon of light
and leader of the Ubium society.
His educational achievement commenced in the international free Protestant Episcopal University
London in 1930, where he had degree in Naturopathy (N.D). In that same University in 1933 he had
a degree in Biochemistry and operated as a Naturopath and Biochemist in the same University in
1935, He had a Doctorate degree in Homeopathic Medicine (DHM). And in 1931 he proceeded to
read for and graduated as a Doctor of Science (D.Sc) in 1950 He had an award of Doctor of
Philosophy in Homeopathic Medicine (PhD) at St. Andrew's intercollegiate foundation, London. In
1962 he obtained a degree in Diet and nutrition. In 1971, he obtained yet another Degree in
Psychology from the University of the Science of man in Great Britain. In 1972 he graduated as
Doctor of Botanic medicine from the Brandridge forest school-London. He was a fellow of Indian
Academy of Science and of self-culture university.
Dr. E. U. Umoren remained one of the major epochal figure in the history of the practice of medicine
in Nigeria. He was a Doctor as well as a teacher of medicine, a great teacher, by his knowledge,
character, and day-to-day life. He lived the profoundest influence on the intellectual and moral
character of his students. He had a most assimilative and alert mind, his lectures and
conversations proved a perpetual source of inspiration. He started the practice of medicine in 1940
and his private practice in 1950s. He was the pioneer practitioner in Homoeopathy and natural
therapeutics and in the training of people to major in Homoeopathy and natural medicine. He did
this in affiliation and collaboration with colleges and universities broad. Collecting correspondence
courses in the training of people and Award of certificate from these institution in overseas to the

natural therapeutics in 1965, with the Registration No. 130384, for all the Homoeopathic medical
practitioners in Nigeria and with him as the First president and Founding father.
According to Dr. Cullen's, "He who has the knowledge of the healing Arts and keeps that
knowledge to himself is committing a sin against God and mankind". He was at home in all the
sciences, even in those which had no connection with medicine. Information could be obtained
from him about them all; for even if he had not particularly pursued any branch of science, he was
sure to have read a great deal about it, "A really educated man" he used often to say "much be well
up in all subjects".
The institution had existed in this way until in 1960, he established cottage Homeopathic medical

with the primary aim to offer a series of study course in homoeopathy and other
alternative medical sciences with a standard and approved syllabus by NIGERIA

НОМОЕOPATHIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION The college operates under the
faculty of homoeopathic medicine guide of 1982.
The college is a private one having no connection with any of a similar
name and exists only on the resources of its own teaching. Having no
governmental grants or aid pending when the federal and state government will
integrate this system of medicine into the National Health Service scheme. As a
private college we feel that this independence is essential for a freedom of
teaching methods The College is advanced in both teaching and research in
Homoeopathy, Naturopathy, Acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractics herbology
and biochemistry. The material is the latest and continual progressive research
will improve on material as research offers new venues of interest and results.
The school has within its staff a number of senior and well-versed instructors and
also a number of visiting professors and honorable members of the board of
regents adding to a total knowledge not to be found in any other college or school
of a similar nature in Nigeria.


science whereas alternative medicine has remained in large part an inductive
science.
One feels that alternative medicine is not clearly understood; its has been
the Cinderella of medicine for so long. Medicine is at its very best when it
incorporate the scientific methods and the art of healing, alternative medicine
embodies such a system.
The world health organization (WHO) recognizing the fact that no system
of medicine is a panacea and the rational treatment consist not so much on curing
or removing diseases, but on restoring maximum function and supporting the
patient in making the necessary life style changes requisite for maintaining this
state. Thus, the practitioner fulfils an essential educative and preventive role,
which is in keeping with an alternative view of nature. Many civilized countries
steps have been taking to strengthen alternative legal position. Some countries
have given federal and state support and have been reimbursed under National
Health Service. Some government has allocated funds for establishment and
research in alternative medicine and also accorded official recognition to this
method of practice.
In Nigeria it is time that this lowly hand -maiden should shed her clock of
humility that is the six sophisticated and highly complex system namely,
homoeopathy, naturopathy, osteopathy, herbal medicine, acupuncture, and
chiropractics, which have gained an appreciable degree of patronage over the
decades in many countries of the world and come out of her obscurity in Nigeria
and boldly proclaim what good she can do to the Nigerians. Hence the
establishment of schools and colleges with and approved syllabus for would be
practitioners in homocopathy and other alternatives medicine. They have to know
the limit of their efficiency; only by proper training and excellence up bringing

However, the ethos of the Hippocratic Oath is retained almost in it's
entirety.
The declaration of Geneva is thus restatement of an international code
of medical ethics which applies both in times of peace and war.
The Affirmation of the Declaration of Geneva by modern college of
Homoeopathy and Alternative medicine graduates is a public statement of
their intent to maintain their high standards of ethical conduct and respect of
learning.
